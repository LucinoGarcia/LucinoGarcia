## I am Lucino Garcia, a data enthusiast, and thank you for visiting my profile!
While I indulge in narrative explorations in anime, possess a deep appreciation for the vast spectrum of global cuisines, and am captivated by physical endeavors – my true passion lies within medicine. I ardently apply engineering and data-driven approaches to each of these. <br>

Many of my data management projects and data visualizations can be found on [my Data Analyst portfolio here.](https://github.com/LucinoGarcia/Data-Analyst-Portfolio) <br>
My machine learning and data science projects can be found on [my Data Analyst portfolio here.](https://github.com/LucinoGarcia/Portfolio) <br><br>

I'm particularly proud of my [real-time EEG Classification project.](https://github.com/LucinoGarcia/Robot-Arm-Classification)
The project I am currently working on is [NLP topic extraction of the Huberman Lab Podcast.](https://github.com/LucinoGarcia/Huberman-Lab-Podcast-NLP-Topic-Extraction) Dr. Huberman covers a range of topics relating to medicine and human health – wonderfully aligned with my personal areas of interest.
